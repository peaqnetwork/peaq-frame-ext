//! It stands for Peaq's frame extension, whereas the term frame belongs to the substrate-framework.
//! We seperate definitions and implementations, that are very generic for substrate-pallets out into
//! this crate. In case someone in the open-source-world wants to use some of our pallets, that depend
//! on this crate's trait definitions, you only have to import this crate and not other parts from the
//! peaq-network-node.
//! 
//! ### Features
//! 
//! Currently, there is one use case for the averaging-capability in the peaq-network-node, that is 
//! Currency-based. For this use case we designed a pallet-mockup, to be able to write independent
//! unit-tests for pallets, that uses the averaging-traits. If you want to use this mockup, the feature
//! "mockup-avg-currency" needs to be enabled. Feel free to add other datatype-based mockups, or a
//! datatype-independent mockup.
